Our vision: motivating people to adopt a plant-based lifestyle as well acting more responsibly towards our environment, thereby creating a sustainable future for all living beings on the planet.​​ Even our packaging has its eye on the protection of the environment: compostable internal wrapping film made from recycled plastic, cardboard sleeves free from mineral oil, or the transparent Sustainability Score – these are our contribution to a more sustainable world – Good for you, better for everyone.",
